# ENPM 701 - Homework 1

## Overview
This project analyzes **pitch angle data** from an **ADXL327 3-axis accelerometer** mounted on a ground robot. The objective is to process and visualize the accelerometer data, compute moving averages, and analyze the results.

The assignment includes:
- **Loading IMU data** from `imudata.txt`
- **Plotting raw pitch angle data** (5th column of the dataset)
- **Computing moving averages** for window sizes **2, 4, 8, 16, 64, and 128 points**
- **Overlaying moving averages on the raw data**
- **Calculating and displaying mean and standard deviation** for each moving average window
